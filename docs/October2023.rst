X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a core technique of the DOE
synchrotron user facilities and attracts diverse scientific
communities. This 3-day course offered by NSLS-II experts introduced
XAS data analysis to new and prospective users and provide an
opportunity to perform real experiments at NSLS-II XAS beamlines. The
first two days were devoted to the fundamentals of XAS analysis, data
reduction and processing, and the basics of XAS experiments and
instrumentation.

Participants were trained on XAS data analysis of increasing
complexity.  Modern XAS methods such as high-resolution spectroscopy
were be introduced. On the third day, the participants participated in
the experiments at XAS beamlines and analyzed the data they collected.

This course was organized and presented by Lu Ma, Bruce Ravel, and Eli
Stavitski with additional lectures by Denis Leshchev and Akhil Tayal.
We are grateful to Mercy Baez and Mariah Barget for logistical support.

:EXAFS analysis I:

   An introductory EXAFS data analysis problem using FeS\
   :sub:`2`. This is the introduction to fitting EXAFS data analysis
   with Feff and Artemis

:Sample preparation and sample environments:

   A discussion of how to plan for your XAS experiment, how to prepare
   your samples for measurement, and how to plan for *in situ* and
   *operando* experiments

   + Presenter: `Eli Stavitski <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/istavitski>`__
   + Slide deck: :download:`Sample prep and sample environments.pdf <_static/October2023/Sample prep and sample environments.pdf>`



Wednesday, October 11
---------------------

:XANES analysis:

   An introduction to methods and challenges of XANES analysis.

   + Presenter: `Denis Leshchev <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/dleshchev>`__
   + Slide deck: 

   | 

:EXAFS analysis II:

   The FeS\ :sub:`2` example from the previous day might seem a bit
   too simple.  It involves analysis of a crystalline material, thus
   the path through the analysis obviously starts with crystal data.
   In these two lectures, some ideas are presented about how to
   perform EXAFS analysis on more complex materials.

   + Presenter: `Bruce Ravel <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/bravel>`__
   + EXAFS and non-crystalline materials: :download:`noxtal.pdf <_static/October2023/noxtal.pdf>`
   + A hard EXAFS problem, Hg bound to nucleotides: :download:`hgdna.pdf <_static/October2023/hgdna.pdf>`

:High energy resolution techniques:

   High energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD), X-ray
   emission spectroscopy (XES), and resonant inelastic X-ray
   spectroscopy (RIXS) using crystal spectrometers.

   + Presenter: `Denis Leshchev <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/dleshchev>`__
   + Slide deck: 

   | 

:Combined techniques:

   How to plan for and implement additional measurement techniques
   such as XRD and DRIFTS during your XAS experiment.

   measured in transmission 
#. `Hematite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite>`__: Fe\
   :sub:`2`\ O\ :sub:`3`, measured in transmission 
#. `Pyrite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite>`__: FeS\ :sub:`2`,
   measured in transmission 
#. `Vesuvianite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesuvianite>`__:

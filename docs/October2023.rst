October 10-12, 2023
===================

X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a core technique of the DOE
synchrotron user facilities and attracts diverse scientific
communities. This 3-day course offered by NSLS-II experts will
introduce XAS data analysis for new and prospective users and provide
an opportunity to perform real experiments at NSLS-II XAS
beamlines. The first day will be devoted to fundamentals of XAS
analysis, data reduction and processing, and basics of XAS experiments
and instrumentation.

Participants will be trained hands-on on XAS data analysis of
increasing complexity. Modern XAS methods such as high-resolution
spectroscopy will also be introduced. On the third day, the
participants will participate in the experiments at XAS beamlines and
analyze the data they collect.

This course was organized and presented by Lu Ma, Bruce Ravel, and Eli
Stavitski with additional lectures by Denis Leshchev and Akhil Tayal.
We are grateful to Mercy Baez and Mariah Barget for logistical support.

:EXAFS analysis I:

   An introductory EXAFS data analysis problem using FeS\
   :sub:`2`. This is the introduction to fitting EXAFS data analysis
   with Feff and Artemis

   + Presenter: `Bruce Ravel <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/bravel>`__
   + |mu|\ (E) data: :download:`FeS2_RT.xmu <_static/October2023/FeS2/FeS2_RT.xmu>`

:Sample preparation and sample environments:

   A discussion of how to plan for your XAS experiment, how to prepare
   your samples for measurement, and how plan for *in situ* and
   *operando* experiments

   + Presenter: `Eli Stavitski <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/istavitski>`__
   + Slide deck: :download:`Sample prep and sample environments.pdf <_static/October2023/Sample prep and sample environments.pdf>`



Wednesday, October 11
---------------------

:XANES analysis:

   + Presenter: `Denis Leshchev <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/dleshchev>`__
   + Slide deck: 

   | 

:EXAFS analysis II:

   The problem with the FeS\ :sub:`2` example from the previous day is
   that it is analysis of a crystalline material, thus it is obvious
   how to approach the analysis problem starting with crystal data.
   In these lectures, Bruce presented some thoughts about how to start
   EXAFS analysis on more complex materials.

   + Presenter: `Bruce Ravel <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/bravel>`__
   + EXAFS and non-crystalline materials: :download:`noc=xtal.pdf <_static/October2023/noxtal.pdf>`
   + A hard EXAFS problem, Hg bound to nucleotides: :download:`hgdna.pdf <_static/October2023/hgdna.pdf>`

X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a core technique of the DOE
synchrotron user facilities and attracts diverse scientific
communities. This 3-day course offered by NSLS-II experts introduced
XAS data analysis to new and prospective users and provided an
opportunity to participate in measurements at NSLS-II XAS
beamlines. The first two days were devoted to the fundamentals of XAS
analysis, data reduction and processing, and the basics of XAS
experiments and instrumentation.

Participants were trained on XAS data analysis of increasing
complexity.  Modern XAS methods such as high-resolution spectroscopy
were be introduced. On the third day, the participants participated in
experiments at the three XAS beamlines.

This course was organized and presented by Lu Ma, Bruce Ravel, and Eli
Stavitski with additional lectures by Denis Leshchev and Akhil Tayal
and help from Dali Yang.  Kerri Banaszek provided logistical support.

Wednesday, March 20
---------------------

:Sample preparation and sample environments:

   A discussion of how to plan for your XAS experiment, how to prepare
   your samples for measurement, and how to plan for *in situ* and
   *operando* experiments

   + Presenter: `Eli Stavitski <https://www.bnl.gov/staff/istavitski>`__

:EXAFS analysis II:

   The FeS\ :sub:`2` example from the previous day might seem a bit
   too simple.  It involves analysis of a crystalline material, thus
   the path through the analysis obviously starts with crystal data.
   In these two lectures, some ideas are presented about how to
   perform EXAFS analysis on more complex materials.

   High energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD), X-ray
   emission spectroscopy (XES), and resonant inelastic X-ray
   spectroscopy (RIXS) using crystal spectrometers.

:Combined techniques:

   How to plan for and implement additional measurement techniques
   such as XRD and DRIFTS during your XAS experiment.

   Data from QAS


Data from BMM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the hands-on experiment at BMM in the morning, we measured
several Mn standards along with the mineral `babingtonite
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babingtonite>`__ in fluorescence at the
Mn and Fe edges.

In the afternoon, we measured several Zn standards along with the
mineral `petedunnite <http://webmineral.com/data/Petedunnite.shtml>`__
in fluorescence at the Zn and Fe edges.

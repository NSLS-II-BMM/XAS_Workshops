X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a core technique of the DOE
synchrotron user facilities and attracts diverse scientific
communities. This 3-day course offered by NSLS-II experts introduced
XAS data analysis to new and prospective users and provided an
opportunity to participate in measurements at NSLS-II XAS
beamlines. The first two days were devoted to the fundamentals of XAS
analysis, data reduction and processing, and the basics of XAS
experiments and instrumentation.

Participants were trained on XAS data analysis of increasing
complexity.  Modern XAS methods such as high-resolution spectroscopy
were be introduced. On the third day, the participants participated in
experiments at the three XAS beamlines.

-------------------

:XANES analysis and high energy resolution techniques:

   Interpretation of the XANES spectrum and an overview of
   fingerprinting and analysis methods.

:EXAFS analysis II:

   The FeS\ :sub:`2` example from the previous day might seem a bit
   too simple.  It involves analysis of a crystalline material, thus
   the path through the analysis obviously starts with crystal data.
   In these two lectures, some ideas are presented about how to
   perform EXAFS analysis on more complex materials.

   such as XRD and DRIFTS during your XAS experiment.

Data from BMM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The morning session at BMM had to be canceled due to some equipment
failures at the beamline.

During the hands-on experiment at BMM in the afternoon, we measured
several Mn standards along with the mineral `babingtonite
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babingtonite>`__ in fluorescence at the
Mn and Fe edges.
